<h3>Why NYC?</h3>
New York City was an important locations throughout the modern era. In the early 20th century, the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, which killed 146 workers, emphasized how employment rules and regulations were necessary and sparked improvement in factory safety standards. In addition, the Harlem Renaissance, which was the cultural growth of the African American population in NYC, gave African Americans a new identity that encouraged the appreciation of their past histories. NYC has affected American foreign policies as well as culture. With the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers, the US moved from a reactive policy to a proactive policy in regards to its enemies. The 9/11 attacks also led to a greater focus on home life, higher church attendance, and increased patriotism.

<h3>Carnegie Hall</h3>
Located at 881 Seventh Avenue, Carnegie Hall is a concert hall in the middle of NYC. Designed by William Burnet Tuthill and supported by Andrew Carnegie, the Hall has over 3,600 seats divided between three auditoriums. Originally, the building was supposed to be named the "Music Hall." The building was renovated in both 1986 and 2003 by James Polshek. In addition, the 60-floor Carnegie Hall Tower was built in 1989 to add offices, backstage space, and banquet areas to the Hall. Carnegie Hall is still around today and would be an excellent place for a APUSH class to visit because of its tradition and prestige.

<h3>UN Headquarters</h3>
Built in 1954, the United Nations was intended to replace the League of Nations, which was ineffective partly because the United States refused to participate. The organization's headquarters is in NYC, but it also has offices in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The United Nations had a major role in world politics after WWII. In the Cold War, it was the mediator between the US and USSR as they fought over the Cuban Missile Crisis. In addition, the UN contributed troops to both the Korean and Vietnam wars, and it supported the state of Israel in 1947. The UN also affects the world today through its representatives from many nations and its peacekeeping force. The UN Headquarters would be a fun place to sleep for any APUSH class. All they have to do is ask.

<h3>Richard Feynman</h3>
Born in NYC on May 11, 1918, Richard Feynman was one of the most influential theoretical physicists in the 20th century. He worked in areas like quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of liquid helium. Feynman was also part of the Manhattan Project, but he was only a junior physicist and not central to the project. After the War, Feynman moved to Cornell University to teach theoretical physics from 1945 to 1950. He married Arline Greenbaum and had two children, Carl and Michelle. Feynman died on February 15, 1988 from two rare forms of cancer. Richard Feynman, born in NYC, essentially established the basics of quantum mechanics as we know them, and he contributed to many other disciplines of physics as well.
