<h3>Why Greensboro?</h3>
Greensboro was extremely important during the Civil Rights Movement. When four African American college students, Joseph McNeil, Franklin McCain, Ezell Blair, Jr., and David Richmond, sat down at a local Woolworth five-and-dime store and waited to be served. The lunch counter refused to serve the men and asked them to leave. The next day, more students joined the sit-in from various colleges around the city. By the end of the week, sit-ins were taking place all over North Carolina. The sit-in movement also spread to places like Kentucky, Virginia, and Nashville. Because Woolworth's profits decreased by 33 percent, the business was forced to desegregate. In addition, the sit-ins received national media and government attention. 
The sit-in movement, starting with a lunch counter in Greensboro, gave power to college students in the Civil Rights Movement through peaceful demonstrations.

<h3>Civil Rights Center</h3>
The International Civil Rights Center & Museum in Greensboro, North Carolina, is in the old Woolworth's that started the Civil Rights Sit-in Movement. Established in 2001, the museum is located on 134 Elm Street in downtown Greensboro. Unfortunately, even though the center receives millions in donations every year, it has had financial issues in the past. 
Every year the museum also hosts an annual Black and White Ball with themes like "Make a Change" and "Celebrating Our Victories." While the building itself has changed purposes, it still remains as the beginning of the sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement and would be a great place to spend the night.
