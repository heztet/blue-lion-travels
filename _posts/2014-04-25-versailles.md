<h3>Basic Information</h3>
Located in the western part of Paris, Versailles today is the wealthy suburb of Paris and a major tourist destination. With a population of about 90,000, the city was founded by King Louis XIV as the capital of France from 1682 to 1789. Occasionally, the Congress of France meets in the Chateau de Versailles to vote on changes to their Constitution.

<h3>Why Versailles?</h3>
In addition to being located within the cultural and historical epicenter that is Paris, Versailles houses numerous historical locations. In addition, the area has seen some of the most famous treaties in American history, such as the Treaty of Paris in 1783. Also, the area hosted the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended World War I. When President Wilson did not include Republicans in the Treaty conference, the party as a whole (and mainly the "Irreconcilables") refused to sign the treaty because they feared that the League of Nations would interfere with America's sovereignty. In addition, Germany was forced to accept the treaty, and the original power structure of Europe was maintained. Both of these provisions led to the start of World War II. Versailles is a special place to visit because of its historical significance to both WWI and the beginning of WWII.

<h3>Château de Versailles</h3>
Built during four different French Kings and through four separate designs, the Palace of Versailles originally was a simple hunting village until the royal family decided to live there in 1682. There they remained until 1789 when King Louis XVI and his family was forced to travel to Paris to be executed. Today, the Palace also stands as the symbol of the absolute monarchy during the Ancient Régime of France. The building features seven rooms modeled after the seven planets (at the time) and the Roman dieties assigned to them: Diane, Mars, Mercure, d'Apollon, Jupiter, Saturne, and Vénus. The Palace of Versailles is intimately related to the end of WWI because it was the location of the Paris Peace Conference, and it would be an excellent place for any APUSH-weary class to sleep for a few decades.

<h3>Notre-Dame</h3>
Built by Jules Hardouin-Mansart and consecrated in 1686, the Church of Notre-Dame (not to be confused with the Notre Dame Cathedral) is located in Versailles, France, on the Rue de la Paroisse. It was ordered to be built by King Louis XIV. Before the French Revolution, the church oversaw the baptisms, marriages, and burials of the French royal family. A new chapel was added to the church by Le Poittevin in 1873. The church also has a cemetery that covers about 2.5 square acres.

<h3>Woodrow Wilson</h3>
Born on March 4, 1913, Thomas Woodrow Wilson was the 28th President of the United States. Even though he was born in Virginia, he grew up in Georgia and was elected the Governor of New Jersey in 1911. During his first term as president, he focused mostly on domestic matters, such as anti-monopoly laws, business regulations, workers' rights, and the Federal Reserve. He entered the United States into World War I after the Zimmerman Note, which encouraged Mexico to invade the US. After the end of the war, he joined European leaders in Versailles to form the Treaty of Versailles. Although he succeeded in forming the League of Nations, his political enemies like Senator Henry Lodge opposed the League. Wilson's biggest achievement and blunder occurred in Versailles; he both formed the League of Nations and did not include Republicans in the peace talks.
