<h3>Basic Information</h3>
The state capital of Hawaii, Honolulu is located on the island of Oahu. Honolulu means "sheltered bay" in Hawaiian. It has been the capital of Hawaii since 1845 and has a population of about 400,000. Its economy mainly focuses on tourism, which amounts to about $10 billion annually. In addition, the city is a major business and trading hub between Eastern and Western cities, as well as a center for military defense and research.

<h3>Why Honolulu?</h3>
The city of Honolulu saw arguably one of the most important events of the Second World War. In the beginning, the United States preferred to stay out of the war for both domestic and economic reasons. While the Zimmerman Note, an offered deal between Germany and Mexico, led some to believe the US should enter the war, only the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, would push the United States to fully join the Allies side. Because the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was the first attack on US soil since the Mexican-American war, the US experienced a major emotional outcry from its citizens and led Congress to declare war on the Empire of Japan. The Axis powers soon declared war on the US afterwards. Honolulu is an important site to visit because it hosted the event that pushed America into one of the most world-consuming events in the HISTORY OF EVER.

<h3>USS Arizona</h3>
Commemorating the lives of the 1,102 sailors killed on the USS <i>Arizona</i> during the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USS <i>Arizona</i> Memorial was built in 1962. Visited by almost one million people annually, it can be visited only by boat. The memorial rests above the sunken battle ship. Designed by Alfred Preis, it is 184 feet long and has two peaks to represent American pride before, during, and after the war. The memorial has three main parts: the entry room, assembly room, and shrine.

<h3>Aloha Tower</h3>
Opened on September 11, 1926, the Aloha Tower is a lighthouse on the coast of Honolulu. During World War II, the Tower was protected by Coast Guardsmen and was painted in camouflage. Designed by Arthur L. Reynolds in a Gothic style, the building is about 10 feet tall and was the tallest structure in Hawaii until 1975. The Aloha tower Development Corporation works today on modernizing the Tower's infrastructure, and the Hawaii Pacific University bought the property in order to convert a part of it into student housing and dining in 2015.
