<h3>Basic Information</h3>
A resort city on the north coast of the Black Sea, Yalta is the capital of the Yalta municipality, one of the 25 "counties" of the Republic of Crimea. Yalta used to be a colony founded by Greek sailors. Its existence was first recorded by an Arab geographer in the 12th century. Today, the city is struggling because its tourists have been going to European holiday resorts because they now have the freedom to travel. Yalta has a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean, with an average temperature of 75 degrees Ferinheight.

<h3>Why Yalta?</h3>
Yalta is critical to the Second World War because it is the location of the Yalta Conference. A meeting between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, it was held in February of 1945 to discuss postwar plans for the Allies. Roosevelt realized that the other two nations had no intentions of following the ideas of the Atlantic Charter, and therefore he was forced to agree with some of the new policies the other two leaders devised. One was the expansion of Russia's "sphere of influence" into the Baltic states. Another was the Soviet's entry into the Pacific theater. While Roosevelt announced that the Yalta Conference was a great success, he privately thought that the meeting only destroyed the Atlantic Charter agreement. Yalta is an important city because of its relation to the agreements between the Allies shortly before the war and their effects on the European nations.

<h3>Livadia Palace</h3>
The summer retreat of the last Russian tsar Nicholas II, Livadia palace now hosts both a museum and the occasional international summit. The original structure was built by Ippolito Monighetti and contained both a large and small palace as well as a chapel, but Nicholas and his wife loved the Renaissance palaces and paid Nikolay Krasnov to build a new imperial palace. The Livadia Palace is made of white granite and built in the Neo-Renaissance. The building has many different features, like an arched portico, an Arabic patio, and a Florentine Tower. The palace has 116 rooms, and each is decorated in a different style. The Livadia Palace also hosted the Yalta Conference in 1945.

<h3>Vorontsov Palace</h3>
Also called the Alupka Palace, the Vorontsov Palace at the foot of the Crimean Mountains. Just outside the town of Yalta, the palace is one of the oldest and largest palaces in Crimea. Designed by Edward Blore and built by Prince Mikhail Semoyonovich Vorontsov, it served as a meeting place for the Russian Empire's elite class. The palace is part of the "Palace-Park Complex," which is a national historical site that includes the Massandra Palace nearby. The building features both English and Islamic architectural styles, such as the Tudor Renaissance features on the north side and the Jummah Masjid mosque influences on the south side. The palace has 150 rooms, most of which have wood block floors. The Vorontsov Palace is surrounded by about 99 acres of gardens and parks, designed by landscaper Carolus Keebach. Unfortunately, the west wing is in danger of collapsing, with large cracks in the library and new sewage pipe creating a landslide danger.

<h3>FDR</h3>
Born on October 27, 1858, Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) was a Democrat and the 32nd President of the United States. He served as President for longer than any other President. His father James and his mother Sara had Dutch and French ancestries. FDR was an only child. The family lived in New York and was very wealthy and influential. He was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy during Wilson's presidency. He won against Herbert Hoover in 1933 and faced two of the most difficult times in American history: the Great Depression and World War II. His famous New Deal gave people jobs in creating public building to help fight the Great Depression. Also, while FDR attended many conferences during WWII, one of the most important ones was here in Yalta, where the USSR's role in the end of the war was decided. FDR was extremely influential in American history, and one of his more well-known conferences was located in this city.
