<h3>Basic Information</h3>
A resort city on the north coast of the Black Sea, Yalta is the capital of the Yalta municipality, one of the 25 "counties" of the Republic of Crimea. Yalta used to be a colony founded by Greek sailors. Its existence was first recorded by an Arab geographer in the 12th century. Today, the city is struggling because its tourists have been going to European holiday resorts because they now have the freedom to travel. Yalta has a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean, with an average temperature of 75 degrees Ferinheight.

<h3>Livadia Palace</h3>
The summer retreat of the last Russian tsar Nicholas II, Livadia palace now hosts both a museum and the occasional international summit. The original structure was built by Ippolito Monighetti and contained both a large and small palace as well as a chapel, but Nicholas and his wife loved the Renaissance palaces and paid Nikolay Krasnov to build a new imperial palace. The Livadia Palace is made of white granite and built in the Neo-Renaissance. The building has many different features, like an arched portico, an Arabic patio, and a Florentine Tower. The palace has 116 rooms, and each is decorated in a different style. The Livadia Palace also hosted the Yalta Conference in 1945.
