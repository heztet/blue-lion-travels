<h3>Basic Information</h3>
A resort city on the north coast of the Black Sea, Yalta is the capital of the Yalta municipality, one of the 25 "counties" of the Republic of Crimea. Yalta used to be a colony founded by Greek sailors. Its existence was first recorded by an Arab geographer in the 12th century. Today, the city is struggling because its tourists have been going to European holiday resorts because they now have the freedom to travel. Yalta has a climate similar to that of the Mediterranean, with an average temperature of 75 degrees Ferinheight.

<h3>Livadia Palace</h3>
The summer retreat of the last Russian tsar Nicholas II, Livadia palace now hosts both a museum and the occasional international summit. The original structure was built by Ippolito Monighetti and contained both a large and small palace as well as a chapel, but Nicholas and his wife loved the Renaissance palaces and paid Nikolay Krasnov to build a new imperial palace. The Livadia Palace is made of white granite and built in the Neo-Renaissance. The building has many different features, like an arched portico, an Arabic patio, and a Florentine Tower. The palace has 116 rooms, and each is decorated in a different style. The Livadia Palace also hosted the Yalta Conference in 1945.

<h3>Vorontsov Palace</h3>
Also called the Alupka Palace, the Vorontsov Palace at the foot of the Crimean Mountains. Just outside the town of Yalta, the palace is one of the oldest and largest palaces in Crimea. Designed by Edward Blore and built by Prince Mikhail Semoyonovich Vorontsov, it served as a meeting place for the Russian Empire's elite class. The palace is part of the "Palace-Park Complex," which is a national historical site that includes the Massandra Palace nearby. The building features both English and Islamic architectural styles, such as the Tudor Renaissance features on the north side and the Jummah Masjid mosque influences on the south side. The palace has 150 rooms, most of which have wood block floors. The Vorontsov Palace is surrounded by about 99 acres of gardens and parks, designed by landscaper Carolus Keebach. Unfortunately, the west wing is in danger of collapsing, with large cracks in the library and new sewage pipe creating a landslide danger.
