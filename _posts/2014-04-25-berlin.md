### Basic Information ###

Berlin is the capital of Germany. The largest city in Germany, it has a 
population of about 3.4 million people. Berlin currently has 147 foreign 
embassies, and its economy is based on technology start-ups as well as 
various engineering industries.<br /><br />

### Why Berlin? ###

Berlin was a key location during World War II and in decades 
following. The city was the location of the last major offensive
in the European Theater of WWII, the Battle of Berlin. When the Soviet 
Union surrounded Berlin, Hitler and many of his officers committed 
suicide. 

After WWII, the city was split into 4 sectors for the four
victorious nations: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and
the Soviet Union. Events like the Berlin blockade and airlift led to 
tensions between the US and USSR, which contributed to the Cold War.
One of the results of these fierce tensions was the Berlin Wall, which
was built by ~~the Soviets~~ East Berlin.<br /><br />

### Destinations ###

The most popular tourist destination in Berlin is the Brandenburg Gate.

Built between 1788 and 1791, it was commissioned by King Frederick William 
II of Prussia as a sign of peace. During the Cold War, it was blocked by the 
Berlin Wall. Today, the gate is a symbol of freedom and unity for Berlin.<br /><br />

![Reichstag]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/berlin/resized/reichstag.jpg)

Opened in 1894 to house the German Parliament, the Reichstag is one of the 
most famous historical buildings in Berlin. Although the Parliament argued 
for ten years about how to construct the building, architect Paul Wallout 
would eventually begin construction in 1884. After being partially burned 
down during the Cold War, the Reichstag now has a large glass dome on its 
roof, which gives visitors a view of the entire city at night. The 
Reichstag is the second most visited building in Germany.<br /><br />

![Hotel Adlon]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/berlin/resized/adlon.jpg)

Originally built in 1907, the Hotel Adlon Kempinski Berlin is located in 
the central district of Berlin and directly opposite of the Brandenburg 
Gate. During the early 20th century, the hotel became the social center 
of Berlin. The Adlon housed guests such as Tsar Nicholas II, Thomas 
Edison, Henry Ford, and John Rockefeller. Unfortunately, drunken 
Red Army soldiers set the building on fire in 1945. After the 
reunification of Germany, the Hotel Adlon was rebuilt, and two new 
wings were later added in 2003 and 2004.<br /><br />
