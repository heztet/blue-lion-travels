<h3>Basic Information</h3>
The largest city in Alabama, the Birmingham Area has a population of about 1.2 million. The city was founded in 1871 through the joining of three separate farm towns. Birmingham's economy is primarily based on the steel industry, but bio-technology and medical research is also prominent.

<h3>Why Birmingham?</h3>
Birmingham was one of the major cities in the Civil Rights Movement. In 1963, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) launched a series of nonviolent protests in the city because it was one of the most racially divided cities in the US at the time. The SCLC also hoped that Police Commissioner Eugene "Bull" Connor would attack the protesters in front of the media. At the start of the protests, the SCLC succeeded in filling the jails, and with the arrest of young demonstrators like the Children's Crusade and the attacks on peaceful students with fire hoses and police dogs, Birmingham earned the nation's scorn. Within a week, business leaders gave in to the protesters' demands of desegregation. Unfortunately, a bomb killed four African American girls in the 16th Street Baptist Church just a few months later, highlighting the racial tensions that still gripped the South. Birmingham was a major part of the Civil Rights Movement; it both encouraged demonstrators that their nonviolent strategy would work and that they had to fight for their rights.

<h3>16th Street Baptist Church</h3>
One of the most popular locations in Birmingham is the 16th Street Baptist Church. Founded in 1873 as the First Colored Baptist Church of Birmingham, the building was designed by Wallace Rayfield. His goal was to create a combination of Roman and Byzantine structures. The church is a National Historic Landmark for its part in the Civil Rights Movement, and it is visited by about 2,000 people every week. The buiding, an icon of the racial tensions during the time of the Civil Rights Movement, is still open today (and would be a great place to sleep.)

<h3>Civil Rights Institute</h3>
The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute is a museum and research center that focuses on the story of the Civil Rights Movement in America. The institute has a "living institution" section that uses statues and settings of the past to teach its visitors how to protect basic human rights. In addition, the museum has a exhibit that highlights the contributions of Birmingham to the Civil Rights Movement as a whole. The institute can also be used for meetings, seminars, workshops, and meet-ups for anyone who applies.
