<h3>Basic Information</h3>
With a population of about 650,000, Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States. It is the 24th largest city in the nation. The Residence Act, which approved the creation of the city, was passed by Congress on July 9, 1790. Washington, D.C., is located in the mid-Atlantic region on the Potomac River in the humid subtropical climate. While Pierre Charles L'Enfant was credited with the overall design of the city, its architecture varies from Gothic, to neoclassical, to modern.

<h3>Why Washington, D.C.?</h3>
The simple answer to this question is that Washington is the capital of the United States and is, therefore, an integral part of the United States history. However, that answer is not sufficient for any actual credit. Washington, D.C. has been the site of many historical events. During the Civil Rights Movement, members of the SNCC and NAACP arranged to have a March on Washington for "Jobs and Freedom" on August 28, 1963. There, Martin Luther King, Jr. gave one of his most famous speeches, "I Have a Dream." The march, attended by 200,000 to 300,000 people, led to the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which made discrimination based on race or gender illegal. In addition, during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the hijacked Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon just outside of Washington in Arlington, Virginia. The city has also been affected by events like Roosevelt's New Deal and World War II, both of which added more federal workers to the city and created the need for more federal buildings and complexes to be built.

<h3>Lincoln Memorial</h3>
Capturing the essence of the Temple of Zeus, the Lincoln Memorial was finished in 1922 and designed by architect Henry Bacon. Inside the memorial is a large statue of Abraham Lincoln, sculpted by Daniel Chester French. The monument is administered by the National Park Service. It is 99 feet tall and has 36 Greek columns for each of the 36 states in the United States present when Lincoln died. The north and south walls inside the memorial feature the president's second inaugural address and his Gettysburg Address. About 6 million people visit the monument every year, and it is featured on both the back of the penny and the back of the five dollar bill.

<h3>White House</h3>
Located at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, the White House is the official home of the President of the United States. The building has six floors: the Ground Floor, State Floor, Second Floor, the Third Floor, and a two-story basement. John Adams was the first president to live in the White House. Influenced by ancient Roman designs, the White House has several distinct features such as the extended south front. During the War of 1812, the White House was set on fire by the British and everything had to be rebuilt besides some parts of the south wall. Various presidents have made additions to the White House, like the reconstruction of the Library, China Room, and Map Room during Truman's presidency. While regular citizens used to be able to tour the White House, the official tours were suspended after the 9/11 attacks.

<h3>Thomas Jefferson</h3>
Born in Shadwell, Virginia, on April 132, 1743, Thomas Jefferson was the third of ten children. He graduated from the College of William & Mary in 1762 and had 6 children with Martha Wayles Skelton. Jefferson was one of the most influential Founding Fathers. He was the main writer of the Declaration of Independence and was George Washington's Secretary of State. He founded the Democratic-Republican party to oppose the views of Alexander Hamilton. As president (1801-1809), he focused on the Agrarian Republic, which emphasized a small federal government. Jefferson also made the Louisiana Purchase to encourage small, independent, and republican thinking. Thomas Jefferson died on July 4, 1826 in Charlottesvile, Virginia.
