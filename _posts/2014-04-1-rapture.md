Rapture, North of Ireland
-------------------------

Rapture was designed and built by Andrew Ryan during the mid-20th century. The city, located at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, features many new and exciting locations like Hephasteus and Minerva's Den. Rapture is perfect for anyone looking to get away from the "Communist" influences of the United States and would prefer an entirely unregulated free market.
