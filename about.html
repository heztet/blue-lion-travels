		This site was made for an extra credit assignment in Advanced Placement US History, or APUSH.
		Because effort was a large part of the grade, I decided to make a website because it (a)
		made the project more fun and (b) challenged me to create that looked <strike>somewhat
		decent</strike> absolutely beautiful!
